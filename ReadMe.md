# Stage Manager for Windows

This is an experimental approach to bring the macOS [Stage Manager](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213315) to Microsoft Windows.

This prototype groups applications by their process. By switching between so called "scenes" on the left, Stage Manager hides other windows and the desktop icons, helping you to focus.

Windows can be moved from one scene to another by dragging them onto scenes on the left.

## Usage

Download and run the executable from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/awaescher/StageManager/releases/) or 
 - clone this repository
 - cd into the repository directory
 - run `dotnet run --project StageManager`

To quit, find the app's tray icon (Windows might move it into the overflow menu) and use its context menu to close the app.
 
### Requirements
 - Windows 10 version 2004 or newer
 - [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

## To do

This is an experimental fun project. I don't have any idea whether or not this is going to be a final product one day.

Stage Manager is using a few code files to handle window tracking from [workspacer](https://github.com/workspacer/workspacer), an amazing open source project by [Rick Button](https://github.com/rickbutton).
